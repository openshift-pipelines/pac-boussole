## Overview

**PAC Boussole** extends GitHub Pull Requests with command-based automation
powered by [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/). Inspired by
[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow), Boussole
lets you interact with PRs using predefined GitHub comments to trigger
automated actions.

### Key Features

- Automate PR actions such as merging, assigning reviewers, labeling, and more.
- Works seamlessly with Pipelines-as-Code and Tekton.
- Uses GitHub comments to trigger actions, reducing manual intervention.
- Designed for teams leveraging GitOps workflows.

## FAQ

### Why the name "Boussole"?

**Boussole** is French for *"compass,"* reflecting its role in guiding PR workflows. The name also pays homage to [La
Boussole](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Boussole_(1782)>, a ship from the ill-fated La PÃ©rouse expedition that disappeared
in the Pacificâ€”an analogy that may feel more or less fitting, depending on your experience with this project. ðŸ˜‰  

**Pronunciation:** *Boussole* is pronounced **"boo-SOHL"** (/buËˆsÉ”l/).  

- Sounds like **"boo-soul"** in English.  
- The **"bou"** rhymes with *boo* (as in *boost* or *book*).  
- The **"ssole"** sounds like *soul*, but with a softer "L" at the end.
