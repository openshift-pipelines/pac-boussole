# Prow commands with Pipelines-as-Code

## Overview

Pipelines As Code Prow let you trigger Tekton Pipelines based on GitHub comments replicating some of the prow commands functionality.

## Supported Commands

The following commands are supported:

## Usage

Below is an example usage of a PipelineRun to be placed in your `.tekton`
directory that will listen to the comments issued by a authorized user and use
our pipeline to execute the commands.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: prow-commands
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/pipeline: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code-prow/refs/heads/main/pipeline-prow.yaml"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-comment: "^/(help|merge|lgtm|(assign|unassign|label|unlabel)[ ].*)$"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/max-keep-runs: "2"
spec:
  params:
    - name: trigger_comment
      value: |- # make sure to use |- or it will fail with a simple |
        {{ trigger_comment }}
    - name: repo_owner
      value: "{{ repo_owner }}"
    - name: repo_name
      value: "{{ repo_name }}"
    - name: pull_request_number
      value: "{{ pull_request_number }}"
    - name: pull_request_sender
      value: "{{ body.issue.user.login }}"
    - name: git_auth_secret
      value: "{{ git_auth_secret }}"
    - name: comment_sender
      value: "{{ sender }}"
    #
    # Optional parameters (value is the default):
    #
    # The key in git_auth_secret that contains the token (default: git-provider-token)
    # - name: git_auth_secret_key
    #   value: git-provider-token
    #
    # The /lgtm threshold needed of approvers for a PR to be approved (default: 1)
    # - name: lgtm_threshold
    #   value: "1"
    #
    # The permissionms the user need to trigger a lgtm
    # - name: lgtm_permissions
    #   value: "admin,write"
    #
    # The review event  when lgtm is triggered, can be APPROVE,
    # REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT if setting to empty string it will be set as
    # PENDING
    # - name: lgtm_review_event
    #   value: "APPROVE"
    #
    # The merge method to use. Can be one of: merge, squash, rebase
    # - name: merge_method
    #   value: "rebase"

### Without Pipelines-as-Code

You can use this Pipeline as well without Pipelines-as-Code from triggers for
example. You just need to pass the necessary parameters to the
`TriggerTemplate`.

(feel free to contribute to this README with an example for other users).

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to help improve the
project.

### Development

You will need to install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and use the
makefile targets.

This project use generated PipelineRun as described
[here](https://blog.chmouel.com/2020/07/28/tekton-yaml-templates-and-script-feature/),
you will need to edit the files in the [prow](./prow) directory and run `make` to regenerate
the main PipelineRun. There is a script that inline it in the [pipeline-prow.yaml](./pipeline-prow.yaml).
That allows to separate the logic from the main PipelineRun and be able to use
your editor properly when editing the code (with linters, lsp, checkers etc..).

Please install the pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install` to make sure
your commits include the necessary files.
